Exercise from Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures by Y. Daniel Liang. 
Class: INTRO TO PROGRAMMING 

5.21 - (input via dialog box and output via command window) Make sure you look at pgs 60-62 in Chapter 2 for the formula to use. I would suggest you code the program you see on pgs 61-62 and run and it use it as a good starting place. After you have that solved you can then add some looping structure to get the results to print out in the table format to make the solution for Ex. 5.21.  The output must look like the book, don't forget about printf described on pages 145-147.
